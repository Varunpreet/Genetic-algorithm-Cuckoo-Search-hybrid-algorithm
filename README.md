This code is based on the research paper- “Metaheuristic Multi-Hop Clustering Optimization for Energy-Efficient Wireless Sensor Network” by V. Chung, N. Tuah, K. G. Lim, M. K. Tan, I. Saad and K. T. Kin Teo. In this project, we implement the optimized Genetic Algorithm-Cuckoo Search (GACS) to enhance energy efficiency in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). The aim of the GACS algorithm is to overcome the limitations imposed by traditional cluster and multi-hop routing protocols. The proposed GACS algorithm in the research paper both optimizes intra-cluster (selection of CHs) and the inter-cluster (data paths for transmission) communications. We replicated the results given in the research paper by running the algorithm in a simulated WSN environment with the key metric which is the lifetime of the network. Our experimental results have been very close with those reported in the research and thus validated that GACS is better than conventional GA in clusters based on the optimization and CS-based multi-hop optimization algorithm for an improved network lifetime and energy-efficient algorithm. This project, therefore, is not just an endeavor to re-establish the effectiveness of the GACS algorithm but has, rather, shown its potential applicability in diverse WSN-based applications where energy efficiency has become of prime importance.
